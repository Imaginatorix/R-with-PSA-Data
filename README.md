# R with PSA Data

**Version 1.0.0**

## Exploring R using statistical tables published by the Philippine Statistics Authority

### Description

In this repository, I try to familiarize R by doing data visualization on several data sets to try and answer questions I made up myself. The data sets I gathered from PSA composed of:

-   [Teen Pregnancy](./teen) at [link](https://psa.gov.ph/content/adolescent-pregnancy-philippines-2016-2020)

    -   To learn Time Series Data

-   [Deaths in the Philippines](./death) at [link](https://psa.gov.ph/content/registered-deaths-philippines-2021-1)

    -   To learn Geographical Data

-   [Labor Productivity and Employment Status in the Philippines (2008-2018)]() at [link](./productivityVSemployment/links.txt)

    -   To learn about some statistical measures such as correlation coefficient
